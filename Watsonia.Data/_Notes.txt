THINGS TO WORK ON:

Allow properties to be abstract as well as virtual (specifically for IsValid and ValidationErrors)?
Undo and redo functionality
Have better error messages
	When a standard overridden property is of the wrong type or access e.g. if HasChanges only has a getter
	When calling Select.And without Select.Where
Test using Guids for IDs
Add async support
Add an SQLite implementation
Really have to tidy up the mess I've made of the LINQ stuff
Fix up the documentation
Performance improvements!
	Should we use the type-specific methods (GetInt32 etc) in SetValuesFromReader?
	Should we have SetValue(propertyName) methods instead of using reflection?
LoadedCollections and LoadedItems should actually be a collection of collections and items, rather than (or as well as) names
	Should expose a yield method that recurses through the loaded children of an item
Build the assembly as a PCL
Put it up on NuGet
Have a poke through the generated assembly to see where things can be improved
More XML commenting throughout
Handle lists better
	I.e. if the virtual property is a concrete list type, create that type in the overridden property
	If it's an interface, create an ObservableCollection
Should primary key columns be nullable?  New items could have their ID set to null and we could get rid of GetPrimaryKeyNewItemValue


THINGS THAT WOULD BE AWESOME:

Add a query result cache a la EntityFramework.Extended
Add a second level cache
Add a PostgreSQL implementation
Add a MongoDB implementation
Add syncing functionality for multiple databases
A Glimpse plugin
